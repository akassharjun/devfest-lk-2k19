By running applications on large-scale compute infrastructures and programming platforms that are remotely accessible as utility services, cloud computing provides scalability, high-availability, and increased user productivity.\n\nIn this talk we will look at the nuts and bolts of real world cloud platforms. We will talk about the hardware and the data centers that physically make up the cloud, and some of the scheduling and control software that help keep cloud platforms operate continuously at scale. Finally, we will discuss the symbiotic relationship between cloud computing and mobile apps, and look at how platforms like Google Firebase make it easier to develop world-class apps powered by the cloud.",
